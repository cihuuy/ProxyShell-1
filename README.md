CVE-2021-34473 Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability



### CVE-2021-34473 - Pre-auth Path Confusion
This faulty URL normalization lets us access an arbitrary backend URL while running as the Exchange Server machine account. Although this bug is not as powerful as the SSRF in ProxyLogon, and we could manipulate only the path part of the URL, itâ€™s still powerful enough for us to conduct further attacks with arbitrary backend access.
